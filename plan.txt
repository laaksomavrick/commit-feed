In order to keep this A) simple and b) finishable

*** A simple and stylish "activity feed" for a user's github repos ***

--> Might be a cool idea for my personal page...?

--> render repo | commit; on click, metadata
--> Make it look really pretty & clean
  -> Big text, smooth animation when adding new, random poppy, campy colors


--> On load, grab 5 latest
--> Poll on backend; update db; send event to client on change



TASKS:

  Get all push events for a user
  Save in db
    Wrap in generic activity class; may want to ie add blog posts later
  Create smart poller
  Create notifier for new event to client? sockets; nice-to-have
  // can use polling if lazy

  Render them pretty

  Integrate functionality for blog posts: integrate functionality for stack overflow answers; ???
  Cool if commit colors corresponded to github colors for th elanguage

  Really don't *need* to be real time, but would be cool
  SSR would be nice though if using this for a personal page
  "Right now I'm probably doing X, based on the time of day locally"
