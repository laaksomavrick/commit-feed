essential:
  err popover
  login screen
  task details
  tasks

nice to have:
  kanban/list toggle
  starring boards
  custom board colours



tasks
  list or kanban? both? what to start with?

    => A board has many column...
    => A column has many tasks...
    => A task doesn't necessarily need to be in a column
    => A task DOES necessarily need to be in a board

    make list for now (easier)
